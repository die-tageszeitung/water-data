Several pipes in the water supply system have been damaged, allowing the water to be used inefficiently and a lot of water to seep away. Many villages near Lake Titicaca could benefit from increasing tourism, but unfortunately this is not the case due to the municipality's poor geographical location, climatic conditions and precarious housing situation. Moreover, due to the low temperatures in the region, vegetables cannot be grown without greenhouses.","CommitmentDate":1551916800000},"930":{"index":23985,"DonorName":"Germany","RecipientName":"Uganda","IncomegroupName":"LDCs","USD_Commitment_Defl":0.173705,"USD_Received_Defl":0.0,"ShortDescription":"INCREASED ACCESS TO WATER SUPPLY, IMPROVED HYGIENE AND ADEQUATE SANITATION FOR FISHER COMMUNITIESAT LAKE VICTORIA, MUKONO DISTRICT, UGANDA","ProjectTitle":"Increased access to water supply, improved hygiene and adequate sanitation for fisher communitiesat Lake Victoria, Mukono District, Uganda","PurposeName":"Water supply and sanitation - large systems","SectorName":"I.4.
