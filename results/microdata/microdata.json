Core problem - Due to a lack of technical, professional and institutional capacities, the institutions of the quality infrastructure cannot provide the services necessary for the reliability of drinking water and wastewater analyses and drinking water consumption measurements. Target groups - Consumers of drinking water. Mediators - The national water utility ENACAL (Empresa Nicarag\u00fcense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados), the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud, MINSA), quality infrastructure institutions. Executing agency - Ministry of Promotion, Industry and Trade (Ministerio de Fomento, Industria y Comercio, MIFIC). Methodological Approach - The module supports capacity building in quality infrastructure institutions. The focus of the interventions is on promoting the meso-level. The instrument deployment comprises PTB project staff (PTB = Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) as well as local, regional and international short-term experts who take on subject-specific assignments and tasks in the field of Human Capacity Development (HCD). Key outputs - 1. the analytical capacities for drinking water quality have been expanded and improved, 2. the calibration laboratories relevant to the drinking water sector have improved their consumption measurements, 3. the testing laboratories in the wastewater sector have improved their measurement capabilities and the necessary standards for the wastewater sector have been developed and agreed.","CommitmentDate":1546300800000},"4824":{"index":14346,"DonorName":"Germany","RecipientName":"South of Sahara, regional","IncomegroupName":"Part I unallocated by income","USD_Commitment_Defl":5.79016,"USD_Received_Defl":0.0,"ShortDescription":"REGIONAL FUND FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASIC SANITATION II","ProjectTitle":"Regional Fund for Water Infrastructure and Basic Sanitation II","PurposeName":"Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation","SectorName":"I.4.
