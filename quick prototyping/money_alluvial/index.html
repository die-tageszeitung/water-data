                  <span>Eva proposition (possible viz: channel of spending):</span>
                  Pipeline – money goes in and on the way to the end point, to the people
                  it should help, all these different actors (GIZ, consulting agencies, NGOs)
                  get a different percentage of the money… So of course, it would be
                  fantastic if we could make light of what comes out of this money
                  pipeline in the end – and visualize that.

        <h3>Change in spending according to countries</h3>
        <p>
          There are a few dates I’d particularly like to look at to see if
          spending has changed in terms of where it went to, what countries
          or to what purpose within the water sector.
