            <p>
              Pipeline: money goes in and on the way to the end point, to the people
              it should help, all these different actors (GIZ, consulting agencies, NGOs)
              get a different percentage of the money… So of course, it would be
              fantastic if we could make light of what comes out of this money
              pipeline in the end – and visualize that.
