        <h1>Spending Changes (time and space)</h1>
        <p>
          There are a few dates Iâ€™d particularly like to look at to see if
          spending has changed in terms of where it went to, what countries
          or to what purpose within the water sector.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          How many grant (ODA) German spent in the water sector
          development between 1980 and now?

                Funding is constant over years, with an overall positive trend.
                We see interesting negative outliers for 1993, 2003 and 2016.
                The positive trend doesn't interest only the quantity of allocated
                funds, but also the absolute numbers of projects in place.
                We have a lot of data points with little or no information on the
                year.

                The funding strategies changes over time. Public corporations are always prominent.
                Initially we have smaller and fewer projects, in the years the number of projects grow
                as well as the total amount of money allocated for them. Some countries receive money
                either smaller and larger funds, while some others are capable of getting only very limited amount of money.

                It is also noticable that most of the entries are incomplete. Some projects do not
                have dates and, even if they do, they don't present any information on the donor category,
                making it a bit difficult to trace money and recontruct individual projects.
