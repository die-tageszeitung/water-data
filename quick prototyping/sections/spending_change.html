        <h1>Spending Changes (time and space)</h1>
        <p>
          There are a few dates Iâ€™d particularly like to look at to see if
          spending has changed in terms of where it went to, what countries
          or to what purpose within the water sector.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          How many grant (ODA) German spent in the water sector
          development between 1980 and now?
        </p>
        <div class="list">
        <strong>Parameters kept into account:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>adoption of Millenium Development Goals 2010</li>
        <li>acknowledgment of clean water and sanitation as a human right by the UN General assembly in 2010</li>
        <li>adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015</li>
        <li>the new Water strategy of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in 2017</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="question">
          Did the money spending change over time?
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What countries have been favourited?
