            <h1>Money Flows</h1>
            <p>
              Pipeline: money goes in and on the way to the end point, to the people
              it should help, all these different actors (GIZ, consulting agencies, NGOs)
              get a different percentage of the money... So of course, it would be
              fantastic if we could make light of what comes out of this money
              pipeline in the end - and visualize that.

                  Interesting directions: understand why some countries are being favourited. Why spending
                  is so low for countries such as Sudan or Rwanda? Why is India largely benefitting from
                  the incentives?
                  Understand which projects are put in place. (subcategories could be interesting).
                  What kinds of projects are more likely to be funded? Is there a connection between
                  project's description/category and the amount of allocated money?

                  Trying to understand how the money flow specifically through different companies.
                  Why is KfW "filtering" so much money? What is the exact triangluation between donor country,
                  enterprises/NGOs and benefitting country?

                  It's interesting to note that some projects have been consistently
                  funded. India, Kenya and Egypt are the three countries that received the
                  most consistent funding (both in terms of money and time). Bangladesh and
                  Lebanon are following. However UMICs in general are well underfunded compared to other regions.
