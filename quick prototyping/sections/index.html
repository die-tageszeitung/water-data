          <h1>Money Flows</h1>
          <p>
            Pipeline: money goes in and on the way to the end point, to the people
            it should help, all these different actors (GIZ, consulting agencies, NGOs)
            get a different percentage of the money... So of course, it would be
            fantastic if we could make light of what comes out of this money
            pipeline in the end - and visualize that.

                  Interesting directions: understand why some countries are being favourited. Why spending
                  is so low for countries such as Sudan or Rwanda? Why is India largely benefitting from
                  the incentives?
                  Understand which projects are put in place. (subcategories could be interesting).
                  What kinds of projects are more likely to be funded? Is there a connection between
                  project's description/category and the amount of allocated money?

                  Trying to understand how the money flow specifically through different companies.
                  Why is KfW "filtering" so much money? What is the exact triangluation between donor country,
                  enterprises/NGOs and benefitting country?
