## Description

Here quick static prototypes with minimal visualizations (html + css + js) will
be created to share info and have a bit of interactive overview on data.

In the [sections](/sections) folder a more comprehensive look at our questions with some work in progress visualizations.

### To Do
Maybe at a more mature project stage:
- add minimal prototypes for interactive visualizations
- test on iFrame to check how they should be implemented
